This repository ccontains a bunch of notes and code that I have implemented through self-learning. Most of these resources are either through a free course online or through a textbook that matched the content that I'm interested in.

# Contents
## Reinforcement Learning Code (RLCode)
### Dynamic Programming

- [Value Iteration on FrozenLake-v1](https://github.com/jasoon-chen/handwrittenNotes/blob/main/RLCode/DynamicProgramming/valueIteration.ipynb)
### Monte-Carlo Methods

- [Monte Carlo Exploring Starts on FrozenLake-v1](https://github.com/jasoon-chen/handwrittenNotes/blob/main/RLCode/MonteCarlo/onPolicyFirstVisitMonteCarlo.ipynb)
### Temporal Difference
- [Tabular TD(0) on FrozenLake-v1](https://github.com/jasoon-chen/handwrittenNotes/blob/main/RLCode/TemporalDifference/tabularTD0.ipynb)
- [Sarsa on FrozenLake-v1](https://github.com/jasoon-chen/handwrittenNotes/blob/main/RLCode/TemporalDifference/Sarsa.ipynb)

To run the code on your own computer, you need to install [GymLibrary](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/content/basic_usage/). There really isn't any good tutorial on how to run this except for this one that I found on [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3DyCg0fgx0). I'm running all of the code on `conda version 24.5.0` with `python version 3.9.19`.

The psuedo-code for all of the RL Code is from `An introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Sutton and Barto, Second Edition`
